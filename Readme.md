EH uhh its a AV that only checks for sha256.<br>
Why C? because its fast.<br>
the hash file is half made by me and half got stolen :c<br>
the other half is made by me. What i did?<br>
I did install alot of malware samples and then added all of them inside hash file!<br>
Result? 107MB HASH FILE! yippie....<br>
I hope nobody wont download this repos just for hashes.<br>
dont download it i already added hashes into 1 file.<br>
NOTE: IT CONTAINS A HASH MULTIPLE TIMES I DIDNT CHECKED IT OH NO OPTIMIZATION? NO ITS C ITS STILL FAST<br>
