EH uhh its a AV that only checks for sha256.
Why C? because its fast.
the hash file is half made by me and half got stolen :c
the other half is made by me. What i did?
I did install alot of malware samples and then added all of them inside hash file!
Result? 107MB HASH FILE! yippie....
I hope nobody wont download this repos just for hashes.
dont download it i already added hashes into 1 file.
NOTE: IT CONTAINS A HASH MULTIPLE TIMES I DIDNT CHECKED IT OH NO OPTIMIZATION? NO ITS C ITS STILL FAST
